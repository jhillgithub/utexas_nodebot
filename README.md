### This project was an experiment in Javascript Robotics and provides the following capabilites:
1. Control the movement of a Parrot Sumo Robot through a client web application using Node and Express.
2. Control the movement of the robot using a leap motion controller through a custom gesture api.
3. Apply facial recognition on a live video stream in real-time using opencv.
